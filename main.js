Maybe something about my progress in front-end development, books I read, interesting topics from podcasts and articles, successes and failures in a day plan implementation and so on. And yes, I think it\'s a good moment to start making some day plans and schedules. Who knows, maybe it would help me to become more organised, disciplined and see better results.',
